In Power BI you need to start creating measures for creating useful visualisations.
But first of all you need to link all tables together. To facilitate date usage, it's better to create a date table seperate from the other tables. 

DateTable = CALENDAR(MIN(Sales[InvoiceDate]), MAX(Sales[InvoiceDate]))

#### Measures created:
- AVG Order Value = SUM(Sales[Revenue]) /SUM(Sales[Quantity])
- To create the Purchase Frequency, you first need to calculate the Total purchases and divide them by the days on which a purchase happened.
  The total purchases: Total Purchases = DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[InvoiceNo])
  The Purchase days: Purchase Days = CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[InvoiceDate]),
    ALLEXCEPT(Sales, Sales[CustomerID]))
- To calculate the retention rate, first calculate:

  Retained Customers = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(Customers[CustomerID]),
    FILTER(
        Sales,
        FORMAT(Sales[InvoiceDate], "MM-YYYY") = FORMAT(MAX(Sales[InvoiceDate]), "MM-YYYY")
            &&
        Sales[CustomerID] IN VALUES(Sales[CustomerID])
    )
)
 and then:

Prev Period Customers = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[CustomerID]),
    FILTER(
        ALL(Sales),
        FORMAT(Sales[InvoiceDate], "MM-YYYY") = FORMAT(EDATE(MAX(Sales[InvoiceDate]), -1), "MM-YYYY")
    )
)

To get to

Rentention rate = DIVIDE(Sales[Retained Customers], [Prev Period Customers]) * 100
